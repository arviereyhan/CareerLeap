# Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a natural language processing (NLP) system using Tensorflow. The goal is create model that can accurately recommend text data into predefined job.

## Problem Understanding

## Dataset
To train and evaluate our NLP classifier, we will be using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Kaggle provides a vast collection of datasets, and we have selected a suitable dataset that aligns with our problem understanding. The dataset will consist of labeled text samples and their corresponding categories or labels.

## Metrics
To measure the performance of our NLP classifier, we will be using accuracy as our evaluation metric. Accuracy represents the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.
